# IEEE754-32BitAdder
A 32 bit adder in Assembly following the specification defined in the IEEE standard no. 754. A short introduction to this is outlined in the Readme, which should be sufficient for most, but if you require clarification on the finer points then I refer you to the standard itself (which I myself haven't read in full).
